# Valentine's Pop-Up Card — Ideas & Customization

You already have **one unique card** in `card.html`: an **envelope that opens** to reveal a **constellation heart** and a “you’re my guiding star” message. Open `card.html` in a browser and **click the envelope** to see it.

---

## More unique ideas you could build (or mix in)

1. **“Our timeline”**  
   Open the card → a vertical timeline pops up with a few dates (first date, first trip, etc.) and short lines. Very personal.

2. **“Reasons in petals”**  
   A paper flower that blooms on open; each petal has one reason you love her (you can edit the list in the HTML).

3. **“Message in a bottle”**  
   Pop-up bottle with a scroll that unrolls to show your message. Good if you both like travel or the sea.

4. **“Puzzle piece”**  
   “You’re the missing piece” — opening the card makes a heart or shape “complete” with a satisfying snap-together animation.

5. **“Spotify / song”**  
   Card that “plays” your song: album art, song title, and a line like “Our song — play it when you open this.”

6. **“Map of us”**  
   A simple map with a heart (or two) on places that matter (where you met, first date, etc.).

7. **“Secret message”**  
   First she sees a generic “Happy Valentine’s”; after a second click or hover, the real message fades in.

8. **“Butterfly / wings”**  
   Two wings that spread when the card opens, with a short message in the center.

## How to personalize the current card

- **Message**  
  In `card.html`, find the `<p class="card-message">` and change the text. You can keep “you’re my guiding star” or replace it with something only she’d get.

- **Sign-off**  
  Change `<p class="card-sign">— With love</p>` to your name or a nickname (e.g. `— [Your name]`).

- **Colors**  
  At the top of the `<style>` section, the `:root` variables control colors. For example:
  - `--gold` / `--gold-soft`: star and accent color (try `#c9a227` or a softer gold).
  - `--paper`: inner card background (e.g. `#f5f0e8` for cream).

- **“For You” on envelope**  
  Search for `For You` in the HTML and replace with her name or “For [Name]” if you prefer.

## How to share it

- **Same device:** Double-click `card.html` to open in your default browser, or drag it into Chrome/Safari.
- **Send to her:** Put `card.html` (and this IDEAS file if you want) in a folder, zip it, and send. She opens the zip and double-clicks `card.html`.
- **Online:** Upload `card.html` to any static hosting (e.g. GitHub Pages, Netlify) and send her the link.

If you tell me which idea you like (e.g. timeline, petals, or song), I can turn it into another HTML card in the same folder.
