## 📝 What You Should Still Do

1. **Replace the placeholder message**  
   In `card.html`, find the text:  
   *"Write your special message here. Tell her what she means to you, a memory you love, or something you've been wanting to say."*  
   Replace it with your own words for her.

2. **Optional: personalise sign-off**  
   Change "— With love" to your name or a nickname if you prefer.

3. **Optional: envelope text**  
   Change "For You" on the envelope to her name if you like.
